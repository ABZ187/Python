From  Tanya Arora : Archita: 3
13:51:02	 From  Tanya Arora : Tanudeep: 3
13:51:12	 From  Tanya Arora : Ritu: 3
13:52:12	 From  Tanya Arora : 15-20 volunteers led
13:52:15	 From  Tanya Arora : divide tasks
13:52:20	 From  Tanya Arora : so that efficient and on time
13:52:25	 From  Tanya Arora : they started a buddy system
13:52:33	 From  Tanya Arora : sphere of impact: 15-20 people
13:52:45	 From  Tanya Arora : motivating, investing and assigning tasks
13:53:06	 From  Tanya Arora : what would make it clear: maybe regular events conducted or some kind of training or coaching involved
13:53:35	 From  Tanya Arora : Neida: Do you want to add anything?
13:53:42	 From  Tanya Arora : Very similar
13:53:47	 From  Tanya Arora : she has covered everything
13:54:11	 From  Tanya Arora : Kanika: Would you like to tell us why 4
13:54:41	 From  Tanya Arora : Because her job description was very broad and she had clear decision makingg resp in it
13:54:57	 From  Tanya Arora : eg: figure our structures or ways to make this happen
13:55:17	 From  Tanya Arora : eg: If she had to start the buddy system- invest volunteers, find kids, track progress etc.
13:55:32	 From  Tanya Arora : The JD is very big and she has to make decisions based on how it is implemented
13:56:04	 From  Tanya Arora : Archita- Although I agree with Kanika, I would like to hear specific phrases or sentences that tell me more
13:56:50	 From  Tanya Arora : Kanika- I meant that the vision of the role given to her was very broad and that is why for her to work with existing structures and create a new system- buddy system was hard
13:57:02	 From  Tanya Arora : She had to come up with how.
13:57:35	 From  Tanya Arora : Archita- I understand what she is saying and agree with her but what were the responsibilities she would like to articulate- made me feel like the resp were not as clear
13:57:57	 From  Tanya Arora : what would have made it a 4 is that in that position not only did she delegate and motivate- but what else did she actually do-
13:58:11	 From  Tanya Arora : I can infer and assume given the role but I am def confident on a 3 but not a 4
13:58:34	 From  Tanya Arora : Som- why 4?
13:58:51	 From  Tanya Arora : Som- I would take the 4 factors
13:59:04	 From  Tanya Arora : After working 2 years as a volunteer, IVed- selectivity is high
13:59:07	 From  Tanya Arora : 15-20 volunteers
13:59:25	 From  Tanya Arora : keep them motivated, I am assuming some level of creation- buddy system
13:59:35	 From  Tanya Arora : she spoke to the management- conducted activity
13:59:51	 From  Tanya Arora : I assume, there is some level of negotiation with the management
13:59:59	 From  Tanya Arora : Tanudeep- why 3?
14:00:35	 From  Tanya Arora : This is moderate- clear decision making resp and not some significant
14:00:44	 From  Tanya Arora : I am not really clear on the input
14:00:57	 From  Tanya Arora : Still the role of the coordinator- not considering something new
14:01:18	 From  Tanya Arora : Except for the idea of the buddy system, I did not see anything great
14:01:26	 From  Tanya Arora : Agree there was a med sphere of impact
14:01:51	 From  Tanya Arora : only consideration- clear vs significant decision making responsibilities
14:02:43	 From  Tanya Arora : she also had to design the task
14:02:50	 From  Tanya Arora : the different events
14:03:03	 From  Tanya Arora : not merely a delegation but also involved her taking decisions
14:03:43	 From  Tanya Arora : How much of it is because of articulation?
14:03:52	 From  Tanya Arora : It is a skill to be able to link the role to the impact
14:04:00	 From  Tanya Arora : eg: volunteer management is a phrase
14:05:05	 From  Tanya Arora : Tanudeep: I believe that articulation may be a problem but we have to trust that the selector is ensuring that probing is done enough
14:05:18	 From  Tanya Arora : if you are unable to do it post that, we will give you a score based on what we have
14:05:38	 From  Tanya Arora : based on the evidences, I would not consider articulation as a gap as an excuse to give a higher score
14:06:31	 From  Ritu Mishra : I have a question here, regarding the sphere of impact.
14:06:37	 From  Tanya Arora : Pooja- Firstly, I think to Tanudeepâ€™s point, the role has a specific level of significance but I am looking for the applicants perspective
14:06:49	 From  Tanya Arora : since sphere of impact is the same for 3 and 4, met the bar on both
14:07:12	 From  Tanya Arora : where it comes to decision making resp- I am comfortable with a 3
14:07:19	 From  Tanya Arora : Other things that might have been missing:
14:07:30	 From  Tanya Arora : 1) Ideation- maybe something to work with the team on
14:07:44	 From  Tanya Arora : 2) Execution of the project- not enough evidence
14:08:24	 From  Tanya Arora : I do not think there is a gap in evidence taking or probing
14:08:39	 From  Tanya Arora : Anyone has questions for Pooja?
14:09:22	 From  Tanya Arora : Ideation + implementation = clear decision making responsibilities
14:09:29	 From  Tanya Arora : still leaning towards a 4
14:10:54	 From  Tanya Arora : Trends
14:11:03	 From  Tanya Arora : 1) Very aligned on the sphere of impact and the input
14:11:16	 From  Tanya Arora : 2) Thing we are thinking about is the input of the responsibilities
14:11:32	 From  Tanya Arora : Q- are the responsibilities- as significant in terms of decision making
14:11:54	 From  Tanya Arora : are those things that she has shared in isolation or part of something she was supposed to do anyway
14:12:03	 From  Tanya Arora : her perspective on her own responsibilities
14:12:13	 From  Tanya Arora : did that dividing or delegation involve any decision making
14:13:13	 From  Shyaam Subramanian : That was an example of my question - sorry did not articulate it as well as Kanika did
14:14:21	 From  Tanya Arora : Archita: 3
14:14:23	 From  Tanya Arora : Neida: 3
14:14:27	 From  Tanya Arora : Som: 3
14:14:29	 From  Tanya Arora : Tanudeep: 3
14:14:33	 From  Tanya Arora : Pooja: 3
14:14:36	 From  Tanya Arora : Kanika: 3
14:14:40	 From  Tanya Arora : Ritu: 3
14:14:51	 From  Tanya Arora : Achievements- clear impact in role- met all goals and expectations
14:14:59	 From  Tanya Arora : Resp- have diff events in the year
14:15:15	 From  Tanya Arora : Achievements- managed an event successfully- more difficult than usual
14:15:33	 From  Tanya Arora : she also talks about the buddy system being the biggest contribution
14:15:40	 From  Tanya Arora : she does seem to meet her expectations
